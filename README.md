# What is Seven Servers?
### With so many different programming languages to choose from, especially for web development, I wanted to create and test creating backends in the most popular and useful programming languages. Over a month or so, I created API's in a few popular languages and created the client in Javascript. I measured the developer experience, lines of code and the speed of each API. I have come to some conclusions through my tests.

# Languages Tested
### 1) Javascript
### 2) Python
### 3) Ruby
### 4) PHP
### 5) C#
### 6) Java
### 7) Golang
<br />

# Results.
## The Best Languages
## The Good Languages
## The Okay Languages
