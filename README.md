#### A suite of backends created for the sole purpose of testing different programming languages.

## What is Seven Servers?
##### With so many different programming languages to choose from, especially for web development, I wanted to create and test creating backends in the most popular and useful programming languages. Over a month or so, I created API's in a few popular languages and created the client in Javascript. I measured the developer experience, lines of code and the speed of each API. I have come to some conclusions through my tests.

## Languages Tested
##### 1) Javascript
##### 2) Python
##### 3) Ruby
##### 4) PHP
##### 5) C#
##### 6) Java
##### 7) Golang
